Project 1 Running Instructions: 

1: Run gcc main.c to generate executable file a.out

2: start mininet on your computer (standard 'sudo mn' will suffice)

3: Get your xterm windows open for both host 1 and host 2 e.g. mininet> xterm h1

4: Open a new standard terminal and run command 'sudo wireshark' to check the full packet information 
   being transferred (optional)

5: Select one host to send and one to receive, in this example case host 1 will send and host 2 will receive

6: In host 2 window use command ifconfig to get destination address (ether: <MAC Address>) 

7: Still in your host 2 window type command  ./a.out Recv h2-eth0
   and press enter

8: Return to the host 1 window type command ./a.out Send h1-eth0 <MAC Address> 'Message you want to send'
